# Screen_Guide_PY
Screen guide is a semi-transparent, sizable, moveable, coloured window that has two uses. 
1. It can be used as a screen guide to help you focus on certain areas of your screen.
2. It can be used as a colour filter. There is also a grey option if you want to tone down the glare of a bright screen in situations where you can't access the settings (for example a public computer). 

Screen Guide (Py version)
I wrote this Python version so I could use it in Linux but you can also make the python version for Windows if you want to.
I used PySimpleGui(tkinter).  

There are 2 image files included, ScreenGuideIcon.ico and ScreenGuideIcon.png.
The python file (main.py) includes an OS check which will check for Windows or Linux.
The image file you need depends on which OS you make the exe on, Windows will use the .ico and Linux will use the .png.
